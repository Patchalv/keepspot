Create a new screen for the Keepspot app.

Screen name: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. Read the existing screens in `app/` to understand the routing patterns
2. Read the technical plan in `docs/technical-plan.md` for the screen's
   data requirements and components
3. Create the route file in the appropriate `app/` subdirectory
4. Create any new components needed in `components/`
5. Create any new hooks needed in `hooks/`
6. Ensure TypeScript compiles: run `npx tsc --noEmit`
7. Follow existing code patterns exactly — match the style of existing files
