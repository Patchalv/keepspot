# iOS App Store Connect Pre-flight Check

Validate App Store Connect configuration before submission to catch common rejection reasons.

## Setup Questionnaire

Before running checks, gather information:

```typescript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What is your app's monetization model?",
      header: "Monetization",
      options: [
        { label: "Freemium (IAP/Subscriptions)", description: "Free download with in-app purchases or subscriptions" },
        { label: "Paid Upfront", description: "One-time purchase price to download the app" },
        { label: "Free (No IAP)", description: "Completely free with no monetization" },
      ],
      multiSelect: false,
    },
    {
      question: "Is this your first submission to App Store Connect?",
      header: "First Release",
      options: [
        { label: "Yes, first time", description: "App has never been published" },
        { label: "No, updating existing app", description: "App already exists on App Store" },
      ],
      multiSelect: false,
    },
  ],
});
```

### Conditional Checks

| Monetization  | Skip These Checks |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Free (No IAP) | IAP validation, RevenueCat cross-check |
| Paid Upfront  | IAP validation, RevenueCat cross-check |
| Freemium      | Run all checks |

## Code Verification

Search codebase for compliance with IAP requirements:

```typescript
// Check for restore purchases implementation
Grep({ pattern: "restorePurchases|restoreTransactions", type: "ts" });

// Check for privacy policy link in-app
Grep({ pattern: "privacy|privacyPolicy|privacy-policy", type: "ts" });

// Check for license key / QR code payment bypass (FORBIDDEN)
Grep({ pattern: "licenseKey|license_key|activationCode|qrCode.*payment", type: "ts" });
```

**Required in Code:**

- [ ] Restore purchases button/function implemented
- [ ] Privacy policy accessible from within app (not just App Store)
- [ ] No alternative payment mechanisms bypassing IAP

**If Free Trial in Paywall:**

- [ ] Trial duration matches App Store Connect configuration
- [ ] Trial terms clearly communicated before starting

## URL Validation

Test that all configured URLs are reachable:

```typescript
WebFetch({ url: privacyPolicyUrl, prompt: "Does this page load successfully? Return YES or NO." });
WebFetch({ url: supportUrl, prompt: "Does this page load successfully? Return YES or NO." });
```
