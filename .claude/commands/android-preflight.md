# Google Play Console Pre-flight Check

Validate Google Play Console configuration before submission to catch common issues and policy violations.

## Setup Questionnaire

```typescript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What is your app's monetization model?",
      header: "Monetization",
      options: [
        { label: "Freemium (IAP/Subscriptions)", description: "Free download with in-app purchases or subscriptions" },
        { label: "Paid Upfront", description: "One-time purchase price to download the app" },
        { label: "Free (No IAP)", description: "Completely free with no monetization" },
      ],
      multiSelect: false,
    },
    {
      question: "Is this your first submission to Google Play?",
      header: "First Release",
      options: [
        { label: "Yes, first time", description: "App has never been published to Play Store" },
        { label: "No, updating existing app", description: "App already exists on Play Store" },
      ],
      multiSelect: false,
    },
    {
      question: "What testing track will you use?",
      header: "Testing Track",
      options: [
        { label: "Internal testing", description: "Up to 100 testers, instant availability" },
        { label: "Closed testing", description: "Limited testers, requires review" },
        { label: "Open testing", description: "Anyone can join, requires review" },
        { label: "Production", description: "Public release to all users" },
      ],
      multiSelect: false,
    },
  ],
});
```
