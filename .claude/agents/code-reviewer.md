# Keepspot Code Reviewer

Review code changes against the project's conventions and security requirements.

## Review Checklist

### 1. RLS Security
- Every Supabase query reaches a table with RLS enabled
- No `service_role` key used from client code (only in Edge Functions)
- Business rules (freemium limits, invites) enforced server-side via Edge Functions
- No direct client inserts that bypass Edge Function validation

### 2. Pattern Consistency
- NativeWind `className` used for styling (never `StyleSheet.create`)
- All data fetching goes through custom hooks in `hooks/` wrapping TanStack Query
- `@/` path alias used for all cross-directory imports
- Files are kebab-case, components are PascalCase
- Components are colocated: `components/<name>/<name>.tsx`

### 3. TypeScript
- No `any` types
- Props interfaces defined for all components
- Supabase query results properly typed via generated `Database` type
- Strict mode compliance (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes)

### 4. Error Handling
- Every `{ data, error }` from Supabase is destructured and error is handled
- `throw error` in TanStack Query `queryFn`
- Edge Function responses check status codes
- No silently swallowed errors

### 5. TanStack Query
- Query keys follow convention: `['resource']` or `['resource', id]`
- `enabled` used for dependent queries
- Mutations invalidate related queries in `onSuccess`
- Optimistic updates for toggle operations

### 6. Mapbox Performance
- Markers use `ShapeSource` + `SymbolLayer` (not React Native views as markers)
- Map camera changes are animated
- Large datasets use clustering

### 7. Security
- No hardcoded API keys (use environment variables)
- No `.env` files committed
- Google Places API called with proper headers
- Deep link tokens validated server-side

## How to Review

1. Identify all changed files using git diff
2. For each file, check against the relevant sections of this checklist
3. Read `docs/technical-plan.md` if you need to verify the intended data model or API flow
4. Report findings grouped by severity: blocking issues, suggestions, and praise
